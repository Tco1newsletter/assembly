          students spreading the importance of building healthy relationships in a classroom.
          Children understood the significance of Teamwork. They also learnt to enjoy similarities amongst themselves
          and respecting their differences. A short skit was composed by our smart scholars to represent the same.

          At school, through our social emotional learning (SEL) classes, we aim to explicitly encourage our learners to
          cultivate constructive relationships with others critical to success in school and community setting. As an
          extension to our SEL sessions , EFA Classes 3-5 hosted a special assembly on the theme of Relationship Skills
          held on 11.11.2022. The story is about a very nervous dinosaur named Penelope Rex, who is starting the new
          school year in a classroom full of children. It's the first day of school for Penelope Rex, and she can't wait
          to meet her classmates. But it's hard to make human friends when they're so darn delicious! Despite her
          teacher's insistence that Penelope spit them out, and the firm declaration that classmates are not snacks,
          Penelope just can't resist. That is, until Penelope gets a taste of her own medicine and finds she may not be
          at the top of the food chain after all...By the end of the story, students quickly recognize the importance of
          being a good friend.

          “Essentially, all life depends upon the soil… There can be no life without soil and no soil without life; they have evolved together.” - Dr. Charles E Kellogg . 
          Learners at The Class of One exchanged thoughts about preserving and enriching this precious resource. They took initiative to plant tree and make their contribution to conserve soil.
